% 2D Lattice Boltzmann (BGK) model of a fluid. By Ian Haslam.
%  c4  c3   c2  D2Q9 model. At each timestep, particle densities propagate
%    \  |  /    outwards in the directions indicated in the figure. An
%  c5 -c9 - c1  equivalent 'equilibrium' density is found, and the densities
%    /  |  \    relax towards that state, in a proportion governed by omega.

omega=1.0;    % = 1/tau where tau=relaxation time scale
density=1.0;  % initial density

% These are the weights for equilibrium distribution
t1=4/9;   % Rest particle
t2=1/9;   % "Straight" directions
t3=1/36;  % Diagonal directions

% This sneakily incorporates the factor of of 3 that shows up in the
% equilibrium distributions, so c_squ actually equals c^2/3.
c_squ=1/3;  

% Lattice size

% Set up matrix. The matrix is nx by ny by 9, where 9 represents the 9
% discrete lattice velocities. F is the current distribution for each
% velocity, and FEQ is the equilibrium distribution.
F=repmat(density/9,[nx ny 9]); FEQ=F; 

% Here we set up the boundaries.
% The CI vector is used to efficiently set locations for reflected
% boundaries. Basically, each CI indexes one of the first 8
% (non-stationary) velocities.
% Then BOUND is set to encode boundaries (1) and interior nodes (0).
% ON stands for Occupied Nodes, and the ON matrix encodes the (x,y)
% locations of occupied (boundary) nodes.
% TO_REFLECT is basically the same as ON but with the extra dimension for
% velocities.
